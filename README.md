# Description
- This is inventory application. It's part of https://www.theodinproject.com/ node course. I was tasked to make my own version, which you can see here. I dont think that this is finished project. Although, core functionality is there I intend to improve it incremently, i.e. over time and bit by bit. This one was made before members-only project.
